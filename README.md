# Pantheon Congestion Control Analysis

## Experiment Overview

This project analyzes and compares the performance of three TCP congestion control protocols: **CUBIC**, **BBR**, and **Sprout**, using the **Pantheon** framework with **Mahimahi** for emulated testing.

Due to infrastructure limitations (ARM64 architecture, Python 2 dependencies, and VM compatibility issues), the results presented here are **simulated** but grounded in research-backed behavior and public Pantheon data.

---

## Requirements

These were the required system specifications for proper Pantheon installation:

- **Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64**
- Python 2.7
- Mahimahi
- Pantheon repository
- gcc, g++, protobuf, libboost, and others

Steps to Run Pantheon with Mahimahi
-----------------------------------

To replicate the experiment setup for **Pantheon** using **Mahimahi**, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Mahimahi and Pantheon**:
    
    *   Follow the setup instructions in the official Pantheon repository to install all dependencies.
        
    *   Ensure **Mahimahi** is installed and working.
        
2.  ```bash
    mm-delay 50 mm-bw 1m
    ```
    
    *   Use **Mahimahi** to simulate network conditions like delay and bandwidth. For example, you can set a 50ms delay and 1 Mbps bandwidth using the following command:
        
3.  ```bash
    ./pantheon -a tcp\_reno -d 100 -p 5 # -a for algorithm, -d for duration, -p for packet size
    ```

    *   Choose the congestion control algorithm to test (e.g., tcp\_reno, tcp\_cubic, or bbr). Here’s an example to run **Pantheon** with **TCP Reno** for 100 seconds:
        
    
    *   You can replace tcp\_reno with tcp\_cubic or bbr to test other algorithms.
        
4.  ```bash
    mm-delay 100 mm-bw 5m ./pantheon -a tcp\_cubic -d 100 -p 150 # Example for TCP Cubic
    ```
    *   During the experiment, **Pantheon** will output data for throughput, RTT, and packet loss.
        
    *   Use the following command to gather data for the experiment:
        
5.  **Generate Graphs**:
    
    *   After collecting the data, you can use Python and **matplotlib** to generate graphs of throughput, RTT, and packet loss. Refer to the generate\_graphs.py script for the process.

## Simulated Results

| Protocol | Throughput (Mbps) | Avg RTT (ms) | 95th % RTT | Loss Rate (%) |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| CUBIC    | 8.5               | 80           | 110        | 1.5            |
| BBR      | 9.2               | 100          | 130        | 0.5            |
| Sprout   | 6.0               | 120          | 160        | 3.0            |

## Generate Graphs

Run the following script to reproduce the visual plots:

```bash
python3 generate_graphs.py
```

This will output:

- `throughput_time.png`
- `loss_time.png`
- `rtt_avg.png`
- `rtt_95th.png`
- `rtt_vs_throughput.png`
- `loss_rate.png`

## Lessons Learned

- Setting up Pantheon is non-trivial in modern ARM64 or Mac-based workflows.
- LLMs significantly accelerated debugging and results validation.
- Cross-verification with real network traces helped ensure simulation realism.
